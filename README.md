# Woocommerce Query Report

This plugin provides a way to display a report of queries that were done via the woocommerce search field.

There is a **Woocommerce Query Report** admin page that shows the report on the WordPress backend. Alternatively you can use the `[wqr]` shortcode on a page to display the report on the front end of the site.

## Installation
